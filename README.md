# DLRemoteControl

This [Roll20](http://roll20.net/) script provides a "remote control" for changing [Dynamic Lighting](https://wiki.roll20.net/Dynamic_Lighting) settings from within the chat window. It eliminates the need to open the pages tray, selecting the settings dialog for the page, changing the settings and finally clicking the save button. You can also save presets for settings combinations you use often so you can apply then with one click.

## Use

Simply send `!remote` in chat to display the Remote. Grey buttons show a feature that is currently off, while a red one shows the feature is on. To save the current settings as a preset, click the "Save Settings as Preset" link below the buttons and enter a name for your preset in the pop up.

Presets are displayed below the "Save Settings" link along with a "↺" icon for renaming the preset and an "X" for deleting the preset.

Note: DLRemoteControl only works for the page on which the players ribbon is located.
